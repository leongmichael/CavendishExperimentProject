# Cavendish Experiment Project

#### All manim documentation regarding installation and useage can be found on the Manim community page: https://www.manim.community/ 
We have also left various comments in our code to hopefully assist with animation. At the top of our main file is code to generate 3 dots to give a perspective on the scale of the UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT commands. For any other questions please refer to the reddit community for animation with Manim.

## Scripts

```manim main.py sceneName -pqh```

# Proper Ordering:
- derive G with k still in the equation
- derive k equation rearrange period to k
- derive net inertia
- plug inertia into k, plug k into G
