# Cavendish Experiment Project

#### All manim documentation regarding installation and useage can be found on the Manim community page: https://www.manim.community/ 
We have also left various comments in our code to hopefully assist with animation. At the top of our main file is code to generate 3 dots to give a perspective on the scale of the UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT commands. For any other questions please refer to the reddit community for animation with Manim. Also please note that the version of manim we are using is known as the "community" version (which is supposedly easier to set up than the original version).

## Scripts
### `manim main.py [sceneName] -pqh`
Use the script above to run a specific scene. Replace ```[sceneName]``` with the name of your class/scene that you want to generate/render. The ```-pqh``` is responsible for the quality of the video. For more in-depth explanations check the manim community documentations.
